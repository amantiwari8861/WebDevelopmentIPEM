        <p align="justify">The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an
            ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was
            commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved
            wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a
            17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens
            bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the
            project for another 10 years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6
            February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The mausoleum was opened at that time
            to thousands of mourners.[7][8]

            The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the
            time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$498 million).[9] The
            construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad
            Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to
            reflect natural beauty and divinity.The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the

            Lakshadweep (Malayalam: [lɐkʂɐd̪βʷiːbɨ̆]) is a union territory of India. It is an archipelago of 36
            islands[b] divided into three island subgroups: the Laccadive Islands in the middle with the Amindivi
            Islands in the north separated roughly by the 11th parallel north and the atoll of Minicoy to the south
            separated by the Nine Degree Channel along the 9th parallel north. The islands are sandwiched between the
            Arabian Sea to the west and the Laccadive Sea to the east with the islands located about 220–440 km (140–270
            mi) off the Malabar Coast of mainland India.

            The islands occupy a total land area of approximately 32.62 km2 (12.59 sq mi) with a population of 64,473 as
            per the 2011 census in the 10 inhabited islands. The islands have a 132 km (82 mi) long coastline with a
            lagoon area of 4,200 km2 (1,600 sq mi), territorial waters of 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi) and an exclusive
            economic zone of 400,000 km2 (150,000 sq mi). The islands are the northernmost of the
            Lakshadweep–Maldives–Chagos group of islands, which are the tops of a vast undersea mountain range, the
            Chagos-Lakshadweep Ridge.The entire union territory is administered as a single district with Kavaratti as
            the capital.

            Archaeological evidence from Kalpeni indicate the existence of human settlement in the region from at least
            1500 BCE with the earliest reference to the islands are from the Buddhist Jataka tales presumably from the
            third century BCE. There are references to the control of the islands by the Cheras, one of the three
            kingdoms of ancient Tamilakam in the Tamil Sangam literature Patiṟṟuppattu. The region was captured by the
            Pallavas in the 7th century CE before Islam is presumed to have been brought to the region with the arrival
            of Muslims. In 1n the 11th century CE, the region was part of the Chola kingdom, forming a part of the trade
            route which connected the Middle East with South Asia. It was briefly under the control of the Kingdom of
            Kannur before it came under the control of Portuguese in the late 15th century. After the expulsion of
            Portuguese in 1545, the region was ruled by the Arakkal kingdom, who were vassals to the Kolathiri Rajas of
            Kannur. The region came under the influence of Mysore kingdom in the late 18th century, which was annexed to
            the British empire, following the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799. The region became part of the Dominion of
            India following the Indian Independence in 1947 and became a union territory in 1956.

            The name Lakshadweep means "one lakh islands" (Lakṣadvīpa; one hundred thousand islands) in Malayalam and
            Sanskrit, though the islands are part of an archipelago of few islands. English designated as official
            language while Jeseri, a dialect of Malayalam is the widely spoken native language in the territory with
            Dhivehi being the most spoken in Minicoy island. The region comes under the judicial jurisdiction of the
            Kerala High Court. Fishing and agriculture are the major occupations in the islands.

            The Golden Temple (also known as the Harmandir Sahib (lit. 'House of God', Punjabi pronunciation:
            [ɦəɾᵊmən̪d̪əɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ]), or the Darbār Sahib, (lit. ''exalted court'', [d̪əɾᵊbaːɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ] or Suvaran
            Mandir[2]) is a gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.[3][4] It is the pre-eminent
            spiritual site of Sikhism. It is one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, alongside the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib
            Kartarpur in Kartarpur, and Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib.[3][5]

            The man-made pool on the site of the temple was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in
            1577.[6][7] In 1604, Guru Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru, placed a copy of the Adi Granth in the Golden Temple
            and was a prominent figure in its development.[3][8] The gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after
            it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and invading Afghan
            armies.[3][5][9] Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in
            1809, and overlaid the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden
            Temple.[10][11][12]

            The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism. It became a centre of the Singh
            Sabha Movement between 1883 and the 1920s, and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966. In the early
            1980s, the gurdwara became a centre of conflict between the Indian government and a radical movement led by
            Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.[13] In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of
            Operation Blue Star, leading to deaths of more than 1,000 soldiers, militants and civilians, as well as
            causing much damage to the gurdwara and the destruction of Akal Takht. The gurdwara complex was rebuilt
            again after the 1984 damage.[5]

            The Golden Temple is an open house of worship for all people, from all walks of life and faiths.[3] It has a
            square plan with four entrances, and a circumambulation path around the pool. The four entrances to the
            gurudwara symbolises the Sikh belief in equality and the Sikh view that all people are welcome into their
            holy place.[14] The complex is a collection of buildings around the sanctum and the pool.[3] One of these is
            Akal Takht, the chief centre of religious authority of Sikhism.[5] Additional buildings include a clock
            tower, the offices of the Gurdwara Committee, a Museum and a langar – a free Sikh community-run kitchen that
            offers a vegetarian meal to all visitors without discrimination.[5] Over 150,000 people visit the holy
            shrine everyday for worship.[15] The Gurdwara complex has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site,
            and its application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.[16]

            Nomenclature
            The Harmandir Sahib (Gurmukhi: ਹਰਿਮੰਦਰ ਸਾਹਿਬ) is also spelled as Harimandar or Harimandir Sahib.[3][17] It
            is also called the Durbār Sahib (ਦਰਬਾਰ ਸਾਹਿਬ), which means "sacred audience", as well as the Golden Temple
            for its gold leaf-covered sanctum centre.[5] The word "Harmandir" is composed of two words: "Hari", which
            scholars translate as "God ",[3] and "mandir", which means "house".[18] "Sahib" is further appended to the
            shrine's name, the term often used within Sikh tradition to denote respect for places of religious
            significance.[19] The Sikh tradition has several Gurdwaras named "Harmandir Sahib", such as those in
            Kiratpur and Patna. Of these, the one in Amritsar is most revered.[20][21]
